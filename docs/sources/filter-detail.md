# Detail of Policy Configuration

This page shows how to write your own policies.

As [Policy configuration](https://github.com/osrg/gobgp/blob/master/docs/sources/policy.md) shows, you can define import or export policies to control the route advertisement. Basically a policy has condition part and an action part. A condition part can be defined with attributes below.
 - prefix
 - neighbor
 - aspath
 - aspath length
 - community

A action part is below.
 - accept or reject
 - add/replace/remove community or remove all communities


GoBGP's configuration file has two parts named DefinedSets and PolicyDefinitionList as its policy configuration.

 - DefinedSets

 A single DefinedSets entry has prefix match that is named PrefixSetList and neighbor match part that is named NeighborSetList. It also has BgpDefinedSets, a subset of DefinedSets that defines conditions referring to BGP attributes such as aspath. This DefinedSets has a name and it's used to refer to DefinedSets items from outside.

 - PolicyDefinitionList

 PolicyDefinitionList is a list of policy.
 A single element of PolicyDefinitionList has a statement part that combines conditions with an action.


## Definition Steps

These are steps to define policy;

1. define DefinedSets
  1. define PrefixSetList
  1. define NeighborSetList
1.  define BgpDefinedSets
  1. define CommunitySetList
  1. define AsPathSetList
1. define PolicyDefinitionList
1. attach policies to a neighbor

----

### 1. Defining DefinedSets
DefineSets has prefix information and neighbor information in PrefixSetList and NeighborSetList section, and GoBGP uses these information to evaluate routes.
Defining DefinedSets is needed at first.
PrefixSetList and NeighborSetList section are prefix match part and neighbor match part.

- DefinedSets example

 ```
 [[DefinedSets.PrefixSetList]]
  PrefixSetName = "ps1"
  # prefix match part
  [[DefinedSets.PrefixSetList.PrefixList]]
   Address = "10.33.0.0"
   Masklength = 16
   MasklengthRange = 21...24
  # neighbor match part
  [[DefinedSets.NeighborSetList]]
   NeighborSetName = "ns1"
  [[DefinedSets.NeighborSetList.NeighborInfoList]]
   Address = "10.0.255.1"
 ```

  ----

 #### PrefixSetList
 PrefixSetList has PrefixList as its element. PrefixList has prefix information to match destination's address and we can specify route's NLRI inside.

 PrefixList has 3 elements.

 | Element         |Description        | Example    | Optional   |
 |-----------------|-------------------|------------|------------|
 | PrefixSetName   | name of PrefixSet | "10.33.0.0"|            |
 | Address         | prefix address    | "10.33.0.0"|            |
 | Masklength      | prefix length     | 16         |            |
 | MasklengthRange | range of length   | "25..28"   | Yes        |


 ##### Examples
 - example 1
   - Match routes whose high order 2 octets of NLRI is 10.33 and its prefix length is between from 21 to 24

  ```
  # example 1
  [[DefinedSets.PrefixSetList]]
   PrefixSetName = "ps1"
  [[DefinedSets.PrefixSetList.PrefixList]]
   Address = "10.33.0.0"
   Masklength = 16
   MasklengthRange = "21...24"
  ```

   - If you define a PrefixList that doesn't have MasklengthRange, it matches routes that have just 10.33.0.0/16 as NLRI.


 - example 2
   - If you want to evaluate multiple routes with a single PrefixSetList, you can do this by adding an another PrefixList like this;

  ```
  # example 2
  [[DefinedSets.PrefixSetList]]
   PrefixSetName = "ps1"
  [[DefinedSets.PrefixSetList.PrefixList]]
   Address = "10.33.0.0"
   Masklength = 16
   MasklengthRange = "21...24"
  [[DefinedSets.PrefixSetList.PrefixList]]
   Address = "10.50.0.0"
   Masklength = 16
   MasklengthRange = "21...24"
  ```
   - This prefix match checks if a route has 10.33.0.0/21 to 24 **or** 10.50.0.0/21 to 24.


 - example 3
   - PrefixSetName under PrefixSetList is reference to a single PrefixSet.
   - If you want to add different PrefixSet more, you can add other blocks that form the same structure with example 1.

  ```
  # example 3
  # PrefixSetList
  [[DefinedSets.PrefixSetList]]
  PrefixSetName = "ps1"
  [[DefinedSets.PrefixSetList.PrefixList]]
  Address = "10.33.0.0"
  Masklength = 16
  MasklengthRange = "21...24"
  # another PrefixSetList
  [[DefinedSets.PrefixSetList]]
  PrefixSetName = "ps2"
  [[DefinedSets.PrefixSetList.PrefixList]]
  Address = "10.50.0.0"
  Masklength = 16
  MasklengthRange = "21...24"
  ```

  ----

 #### NeighborSetList

 NeighborSetList has NeighborInfoList as its element and NeighborInfoList has neighbor information to match the sender of the routes.
 It is necessary to specify a neighbor address in NeighborInfoList.

 NeighborInfoList has 2 elements.

 | Element         |Description          | Example      | Optional   |
 |-----------------|---------------------|--------------|------------|
 | NeighborSetName | name of NeighborSet | "ns1"        |            |
 | Address         | neighbor's address  | "10.0.255.1" |            |

 ##### Examples

 - example 1
   - Match routes which come from the neighbor 10.0.255.1

  ```
  # example 1
  [[DefinedSets.NeighborSetList]]
   NeighborSetName = "ns1"
   [[DefinedSets.NeighborSetList.NeighborInfoList]]
    Address = "10.0.255.1"
  ```

 - example 2
   - Match routes which come from the neighbor 10.0.255.1

  ```
  # example 2
  [[DefinedSets.NeighborSetList]]
  NeighborSetName = "ns2"
   [[DefinedSets.NeighborSetList.NeighborInfoList]]
    Address = "10.0.255.1"
  ```

 - example 3
    - As with PrefixSet, NeighborSet can have multiple NeighborInfoList like this.
    - This example checks if a route comes from neighbor 10.0.255.1 **or** 10.0.255.2.

  ```
  # example 3
  [[DefinedSets.NeighborSetList]]
  NeighborSetName = "ns3"
   [[DefinedSets.NeighborSetList.NeighborInfoList]]
    Address = "10.0.255.1"
   [[DefinedSets.NeighborSetList.NeighborInfoList]]
    Address = "10.0.255.2"
  ```

---

### 2. Defining BgpDefinedSets

BgpDefinedSets has Community information and AS_PATH information in CommunitySetList and AsPathSetList section respectively. And it is a child element of DefinedSets.
AsPathSetList and CommunitySetList section are AS_PATH match part and community match part.

- BgpDefinedSets example

 ```
   [DefinedSets.BgpDefinedSets]
     # Community match part
     [[DefinedSets.BgpDefinedSets.CommunitySetList]]
       CommunitySetName = "community1"
       CommunityMembers = ["65100:10"]
     # AS_PATH match part
     [[DefinedSets.BgpDefinedSets.AsPathSetList]]
       AsPathSetName = "aspath1"
       AsPathSetMembers = ["^65100"]
 ```

  ----

 #### CommunitySetList
 CommunitySetList has Community value as its element. The values are used to evaluate communities held by the destination.

 CommunitySetList has 2 elements.

 | Element          | Description             | Example      | Optional |
 |------------------|-------------------------|--------------|----------|
 | CommunitySetName | name of CommunitySet    | "community1" |          |
 | CommunityMembers | list of Community value | ["65100:10"] |          |

 You can use regular expressions to specify communities in CommunityMembers element.

 ##### Examples
 - example 1
   - Match routes which has "65100:10" as a community value.

  ```
  # example 1
 [DefinedSets.BgpDefinedSets]
   [[DefinedSets.BgpDefinedSets.CommunitySetList]]
     CommunitySetName = "community1"
     CommunityMembers = ["65100:10"]
  ```

 - example 2
    - Specifying community by regular expression
    - You can use regular expressions that is available in Golang.

  ```
  # example 2
  [DefinedSets.BgpDefinedSets]
   [[DefinedSets.BgpDefinedSets.CommunitySetList]]
   CommunitySetName = "community2"
   CommunityMembers = ["6[0-9]+:[0-9]+"]
  ```

   ----

 #### AsPathSetList
 AsPathSetList has AS numbers as its element. The numbers are used to evaluate AS numbers in the destination's AS_PATH attribute.

   CommunitySetList has 2 elements.

 | Element          | Description       | Example    | Optional |
 |------------------|-------------------|------------|----------|
 | AsPathSetName    | name of AsPathSet | "aspath1"  |          |
 | AsPathSetMembers | list of AS number | ["^65100"] |          |

   You can specify the position using regexp-like expression as follows:
   - From: "^65100" means the route is passed from AS 65100 directly.
   - Any: "65100" means the route comes through AS 65100.
   - Origin: "65100$" means the route is originated by AS 65100.
   - Only: "^65100$" means the route is originated by AS 65100 and comes from it directly.

   ##### Examples
   - example 1
     - Match routes which come from AS 65100.

    ```
    # example 1
   [DefinedSets.BgpDefinedSets]
     [[DefinedSets.BgpDefinedSets.AsPathSetList]]
     AsPathSetName = "aspath1"
     AsPathSetMembers = ["^65100"]
    ```

---

### 3. Defining PolicyDefinitionList
PolicyDefinitionList consists of condition and action of the policy. The condition part evaluates routes from neighbors and applies action if the routes match conditions. You can use DefinedSets above and other conditions to specify conditions in the PolicyDefinitionList.

PolicyDefinitionList has PolicyDefinition as its element and the PolicyDefinition is a policy itself.
You can write condition and action under StatementList.

 - an example of PolicyDefinitionList

 ```
 [[PolicyDefinitionList]]
  Name = "example-policy"
 [[PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList]]
  Name = "statement1"
 [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Conditions]
  MatchPrefixSet = "ps2"
  MatchNeighborSet = "ns1"
  MatchSetOptions = 1
  [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Conditions.BgpConditions]
  MatchCommunitySet = "community1"
  MatchAsPathSet = "aspath1"
  [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Conditions.BgpConditions.AsPathLength]
    Operator = "eq"
    Value = 2
 [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Actions]
  AcceptRoute = true
  [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Actions.BgpActions]
    [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Actions.BgpActions.SetCommunity]
      Communities = ["65100:20"]
      Options = "ADD"
 ```

 The elements of PolicyDefinitionList are as follows:

  - PolicyDefinitionList

 | Element | Description   | Example          |
 |---------|---------------|------------------|
 | name    | policy's name | "example-policy" |

 |-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
 | MatchCommunitySet | name for DefinedSets.BgpDefinedSets.CommunitySetList that is used in this policy | "community1" |
 | MatchAsPathSet    | name for DefinedSets.BgpDefinedSets.AsPathSetList that is used in this policy    | "aspath1"    |


  - PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Conditions.BgpConditions.AsPathLength

 | Element  | Description                                                                                        | Example |
 |----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
 | Operator | operator to compare the length of AS number in AS_PATH attribute. <br> "eq","ge","le" can be used. <br> "eq" means that length of AS number is equal to Value element <br> "ge" means that length of AS number is equal or greater than the Value element <br> "le" means that length of AS number is equal or smaller than the Value element| "eq"    |
 | Value    | value used to compare with the length of AS number in AS_PATH attribute                            | 2       |

 <br>

##### Examples
 - example 1
  - This PolicyDefinition has PrefixSet *ps1* and NeighborSet *ns1* as its condition and routes matche the condition is rejected.

 ```
 # example 1
 [[PolicyDefinitionList]]
 Name = "policy1"
 [[PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList]]
 Name = "statement1"
 [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Conditions]
 MatchPrefixSet = "ps2"
 MatchNeighborSet = "ns1"
 MatchSetOptions = 1
 [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Actions]
 RejectRoute = true
 ```

 - example 2
  - PolicyDefinition has two statements

 ```
 # example 2
 [[PolicyDefinitionList]]
 Name = "pd1"
 # first statement - (1)
 [[PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList]]
  Name = "statement1"
 [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Conditions]
  MatchPrefixSet = "ps1"
  MatchNeighborSet = "ns1"
  MatchSetOptions = 1
 [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Actions]
  RejectRoute = true
 # second statement - (2)
 [[PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList]]
  Name = "statement2"
 [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Conditions]
  MatchPrefixSet = "ps2"
  MatchNeighborSet = "ns2"
  MatchSetOptions = 1
 [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Actions]
  RejectRoute = true
 ```
  - if a route matches the condition inside the first statement(1), GoBGP applies its action and quits the policy evaluation.


 - example 3
  - If you want to add other policies, just add PolicyDefinitionList block following the first one like this

 ```
 # example 3
 # first policy
 [[PolicyDefinitionList]]
 Name = "policy1"

 [[PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList]]
 Name = "statement1"
 [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Conditions]
 MatchPrefixSet = "ps1"
 MatchNeighborSet = "ns1"
 MatchSetOptions = 1
 [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Actions]
 RejectRoute = true

 # second policy
 [[PolicyDefinitionList]]
 Name = "policy2"

 [[PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList]]
 Name = "statement2"
 [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Conditions]
 MatchPrefixSet = "ps2"
 MatchNeighborSet = "ns2"
 MatchSetOptions = 1
 [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Actions]
 RejectRoute = true
 ```

 - example 4
  - This PolicyDefinition has multiple conditions including BgpConditions as follows:
    - PrefixSet: *ps1*
    - NeighborSet: *ns1*
    - CommunitySet: *community1*
    - AsPathSet: *aspath1*
    - AsPath length: *equal 2*

  - If a route matches all these conditions, the route is accepted and added community "65100:20".

 ```
 # example 4
 [[PolicyDefinitionList]]
 Name = "policy4"
 [[PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList]]
 Name = "statement1"
 [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Conditions]
 MatchPrefixSet = "ps1"
 MatchNeighborSet = "ns1"
 MatchSetOptions = 1
 [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Conditions.BgpConditions]
 MatchCommunitySet = "community1"
 MatchAsPathSet = "aspath1"
 [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Conditions.BgpConditions.AsPathLength]
 Operator = "eq"
 Value = 2
 [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Actions]
 AcceptRoute = true
 [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Actions.BgpActions]
 [PolicyDefinitionList.StatementList.Actions.BgpActions.SetCommunity]
 Communities = ["65100:20"]
 Options = "ADD"
 ```


---

### 4. Attaching policy
You can attach policies to a neighbor after defining policy.
To attach policies to a neighbor, you need to add policy's name to NeighborList.ApplyPolicy in the neighbor's setting.

You can attach policies to the import policy or the export policy inside the neighbor configuration.
This example attatches *policy1* to import policy and *policy2* to export policy.

```
[[NeighborList]]
NeighborAddress = "10.0.255.2"
PeerAs = 65002
[NeighborList.RouteServer]
RouteServerClient = true
[NeighborList.ApplyPolicy]
ImportPolicies = ["policy1"]
ExportPolicies = ["policy2"]
DefaultImportPolicy = 0
DefaultExportPolicy = 0
```

NeighborList has a section to specify policies and the section's name is ApplyPolicy.
The ApplyPolicy has 4 elements.

| Element             | Description                                                                   | Example    |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| ImportPolicies      | PolicyDefinitionList.name for import policy                                   | "policy1"  |
| ExportPolicies      | PolicyDefinitionList.name for export policy                                   | "policy2"  |
| DefaultImportPolicy | action if the route isn't applied any policy;<br> 0 means import,<br>  1 means reject  | 0 |
| DefaultExportPolicy | action if the route isn't applied any policy;<br> 0 means export,<br>  1 means discard | 0 |
