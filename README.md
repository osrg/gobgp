## Introduction

GoBGP is an open source BGP implementation designed from scratch for
modern environment and implemented in a modern programming language,
[the Go Programming Language](http://golang.org/).

## Getting started

Installing GoBGP is quite easy (only two commands!):

```bash
$ go get github.com/osrg/gobgp/gobgpd
$ go get github.com/osrg/gobgp/gobgp
```

No dependency hell (library, package, etc) thanks to Go.
